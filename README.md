# bookJS

My project is based on creating a reading lsit and the order you want to read the books in. There is a weather API and a countdown to finishing the reading list.

Data is saved parsisted to local storage even if the page is refreshed. I learned from my mentors that this was an acceptable requirement.

Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX).
        Retrieving user local weather data from external API.

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
        Calculating and displaying a countdown to finish reading list.

Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).
        Converts days to seconds.
